# X-Team 73 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Volunteer to work on parts of code that we are good at, and then assign the rest either randomly,
or by who has the least workload of the volunteer sections.

## How we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Github commits and GroupMe chat will help us keep track. Suggest completion dates
to keep eachother on pace. Everyone should update on their progress regularly.

## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
If we get stuck on any part of our assigned coding, we can ask for help over the 
team GroupMe.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Let the group know as soon as possible if you won't be able to get your part of the project
done. Set an early deadline so we have time to revise and complete the project before turning 
it in.

## How we will schedule times to meet
List all of our schedules in a google document to know when we are free to work on a project.

## How we will make changes to code
We should all create local repositories to push and pull commits to the repository. Communicate
with group memebers before you push major changes to the code.
